# Webapp to locate at-risk groups against Covid19

A webapp that stores and makes available user-provided geographic data about people from at-risk groups for Covid19. This is an effort to mitigate the challenge of monitoring the social isolation of at-risk groups.

If you know someone that belongs to at-risk groups, please inform his/her location. This location does not identify the person, just his/her country, state, city and neighborhood. Therefore, this webapp allows the storage and use of user-provide data related to where the at-risk groups are.  

With these information, governments and any organization (worldwide) can apply more effective health policies to protect these vulnerable groups against Covid19. 

All structure and frameworks used in this project are free and/or opensource: #heroku, #postgresql, #java8, #springboot, #restapi, #angularjs

In #Heroku, all data stored in the database are ephemeral and do not persist. If someone has any database service that persists data, and wants to contribute in this project, please let me know.
